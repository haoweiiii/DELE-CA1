# DELE-CA1
This repository contains my work for the first assignment of the Deep Learning module at Singapore Polytechnic. The assignment is divided into three parts:
- Part A: Implementation of an image classifier using a deep learning network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
- Part B: Implementation of an image classifier using a deep learning network on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- Part C: A technical paper I wrote on the MNIST dataset.
